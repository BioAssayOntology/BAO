# 2 Curation and Version Release Process

## 2.1. [Data Curation and Template Utilization](https://github.com/BioAssayOntology/BAO/wiki/Data-Curation-and-Template-Utilization)
Bioassay Ontology is systematically curated using predefined templates. These templates served to standardize the information collected and ensure consistency across diverse content sources. The specific fields and structure of the templates were designed to capture critical details relevant to bioassays, including but not limited to, assay design, experimental conditions, and outcome measurements.


The curation template, available as a spreadsheet, can be downloaded from:
