Plasma is devoid of cells and, unlike serum, has not clotted.",,subclass,Date from BAE: 7/6/2016
http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0020004,serum format,PubChem AID: ,cell-free format,http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000366,,Serum is the clear cell-free liquid that is separated from clotted blood. Serum differs from plasma in that the blood is first allowed to clot before centrifugation (separating from cells) while plasma preparations entail preventing blood clotting. Both are cell-free and contain antibodies. ,,subclass,Date from BAE: 7/6/2016
