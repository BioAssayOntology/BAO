#summary Introduction to BAO wiki

= Introduction =

This Wiki is intended to be an internal resource for collaborators on the BAO project. It is designed specifically for the following purposes:
For the publication of intermediate results in advance of official milestones.
For the discussion of new concepts and semantics.
For general information on the project as well as relevant links, educational resources and literature.
For the specification and development of software tools pertaining to the BAO.
It is our intention that the BAO Ontology Development Wiki be used in conjunction with other resources such as the Alfresco Share Site to promote a collaborative environment for the development of the BAO.
As the BAO project evolves, this site will shift to being a general wiki about the project.
Any material used should be referenced appropriately.
