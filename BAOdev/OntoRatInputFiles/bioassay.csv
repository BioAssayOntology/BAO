Assay is used to measure in vitro intrinsic clearance or to identify metabolites formed. Typically liver microsomes from one or more mammalian species (mouse, rat, dog, monkey, human) are analyzed to understand differences in metabolism. Can be reported as % recovery after a set time (single timepoint), or as half-life (multiple timepoints).",,6/6/16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BAO_0010008,plasma stability assay,504605,pharmacokinetic assay,http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002182,,"A common in vitro ADME assay that tests the stability of compounds when incubated with plasma.  Assay is used to measure stability of new chemical entities in plasma, as compounds that rapidly degrade in plasma generally show poor in vivo efficacy. Typically lplasma from one or more mammalian species (mouse, rat, dog, monkey, human) are analyzed. Can be reported as % recovery after a set time (single timepoint), or as half-life (multiple timepoints).",,6/6/16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BAO_0010009,Caco-2 permeability assay,504629,pharmacokinetic assay,http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0002182,,"A common in vitro ADME assay that uses the Caco-2 cell line (derived from human colon carcinoma) to assess transport in both directions (apical to basolateral (A-B) and basolateral to apical (B-A)) across the cell monolayer), to predict the in vivo absorption of drugs across the gut wall and to investigate drug efflux.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BAO_0010010,physicochemical assay,504606,bioassay,http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0000015,,"Physicochemical assays measure inherent properties of molecules, and include turbidimetric and thermodynamic solubility (in water or PBS), chemical stability, pKa, and lipophilicity (logP and logD)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BAO_0010011,solubility assay,504606,,http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao#BAO_0010010,physicochemical assay,A physicochemical assay that measures the maximum solubility of a molecule in a particular solvent (typically water or PBS).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
