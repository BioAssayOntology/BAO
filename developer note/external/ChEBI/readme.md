### OntoFox
To retrieve data from ontologies using OntoFox and integrate it with your own site, you can follow these general steps:

1. Install OntoFox: Begin by installing OntoFox on your local system. OntoFox is a web-based tool provided by the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) that allows users to extract specific data from ontologies.

2. Access the OntoFox web interface: Open your web browser and navigate to the OntoFox web interface. The URL for accessing OntoFox is typically http://ontofox.hegroup.org.

3. Specify the input ontology: In the OntoFox interface, provide the input ontology that you want to extract data from. This can be done by entering the ontology's URI or uploading the ontology file.

4. Configure OntoFox options: Select the desired options and configurations in OntoFox to specify the data you want to retrieve. This may include selecting specific classes, properties, or individuals from the ontology.

5. Generate the ontology subset: Once you have configured the options, click the "Submit" or "Generate" button to initiate the extraction process. OntoFox will process the input ontology and generate a subset of the ontology containing the selected data.

6. Retrieve the subset: After the extraction process is complete, you will be provided with a download link to access the generated ontology subset. Click the link to download the subset file to your local system.

7. Integrate the data with your site: Once you have the ontology subset file, you can integrate the extracted data into your own site. This typically involves parsing the ontology subset file and incorporating the relevant data into your site's database or application.

8. Display and utilize the data: Use the extracted ontology data as needed within your site. This may involve displaying ontology terms, properties, or relationships, or utilizing the data for various functionalities within your site.
